<h1 id="central-simple-algebras">Central simple algebras</h1>
<p>In this lecture, we will see a few beautiful things about the building blocks of the Brauer group, the algebras themselves. A bunch of the proofs here are inspired by (or cribbed from) the beautiful book by Farb and Dennis on non-commutative algebra.</p>
<h3 id="divison-algebras-central-simple-algebras-and-donald-rumsfeld">Divison algebras, central simple algebras, and Donald Rumsfeld</h3>
<p>In studying division algebras, we are naturally led to apply one of Rumsfeld’s famous rules: “If you can’t solve a problem, make it bigger.” (He was <em>very</em> good at this.)</p>
<p>One of the deepest insights of 20th Century mathematics is the observation that rather than investigate the inner workings of a single object, it often pays to investigate associated categories. We usually think this means that we should look at the category of objects of a similar flavor, but “classical” algebra gives us a prime example this idea, due to Morita theory. I will not go into detail about Morita theory, except for its incarnation in our specific case.</p>
<h3 id="simple-categories-and-matrix-rings">Simple categories and matrix rings</h3>
<p>Call an abelian category <span class="math">\(C\)</span> <em>simple</em> if is semisimple and there is a simple object <span class="math">\(c\)</span> in <span class="math">\(C\)</span> such that every object of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> can be written as a direct sum of copies of <span class="math">\(c\)</span> (up to isomorphism).</p>
<div class="theorem">
(Morita-ish) Fix an Artinian ring <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. The category of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>-modules is simple if and only if <span class="math">\(A\cong M_n(D)\)</span>, the ring of matrices over a division ring <span class="math">\(D\)</span>.
<div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. If the category is simple, then we can write <span class="math">\(A\)</span> itself as <span class="math">\(c^{\oplus n}\)</span> for some natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. But then <span class="math">\(A\)</span> (acting on the right) is the ring of endomorphisms of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> as a left <span class="math">\(A\)</span>-module, while we can also compute this endomorphism ring as <span class="math">\(M_n(\End(c))\)</span>. By Schur’s lemma, <span class="math">\(\End(c)\)</span> is a division ring. QED</p>
<p>Why do we care?</p>
<div class="lemma">
For any ring <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, there is a natural equivalence of categories between <span class="math">\(\Mod_R\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Mod_{M_n(R)}\)</span> for any <span class="math">\(n&gt;0\)</span>.
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Exercise! (Too hard?) QED</p>
<h3 id="the-artin-wedderburn-theorem">The Artin-Wedderburn Theorem</h3>
<p>There is an amazing result governing the Artinian rings with simple module categories: they can be characterized algebraically!</p>
<p>Recall that a ring is <em>simple</em> if it has no non-trivial two-sided ideals.</p>
<div class="theorem">
(Artin-Wedderburn, special case) An Artinian ring <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is simple if and only if the module category <span class="math">\(\Mod_A\)</span> is simple.
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. If the module category is simple, we have just seen that <span class="math">\(A\cong M_n(D)\)</span>, and it is an exercise that this ring is simple. (Just do linear algebra over a division ring! More precisely, why not classify all ideals – left, right, two-sided – in these rings while you’re at it?)</p>
<p>So suppose that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a simple Artinian ring. First, given an <span class="math">\(A\)</span>-module <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, note that the annihilator of <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is a two-sided ideal of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> that does not contain <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, hence is trivial. A minimal left ideal of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> (which exists because <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is Artinian!) is a simple module, so, in particular, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> has a faithful simple module that we will also call <span class="math">\(M\)</span>. We will show that in fact <span class="math">\(A\)</span> can be written as <span class="math">\(M^{\oplus m}\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a clever trick: a map <span class="math">\[f:A\to M^{\oplus n}\]</span> with minimal kernel must be injective. Indeed, if not, there is some <span class="math">\(a\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(f(a)=0\)</span>. But <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is faithful, so there is an <span class="math">\(m\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(am\neq 0\)</span>. We can thus create a new map <span class="math">\[f&#39;:A\to M^{\oplus n}\oplus M\]</span> by sending <span class="math">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math">\((f(a), am)\)</span>. This will have a smaller kernel!</p>
<p>Now that we have an injection <span class="math">\(A\inj M^{\oplus n}\)</span> into a direct sum of simple modules, it is an entertaining exercise to show that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> itself must be isomorphic to <span class="math">\(M^{\oplus m}\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(m\)</span>. Using the argument from above, this means that <span class="math">\(A\cong M_n(D)\)</span>, as desired. QED</p>
<h3 id="central-simple-algebras-1">Central simple algebras</h3>
<p>Fix a field <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<div class="definition">
A <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-algebra <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is called a <em>central simple algebra</em> if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is finite-dimensional over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, has center <span class="math">\(k\cdot 1\)</span>, and is simple.
</div>
<p>By the above, any central simple algebra <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is isomorphic to one of the form <span class="math">\(M_n(D)\)</span> for a central division algebra over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Putting everything together, the objects making up the Brauer group – the central division algebras <span class="math">\(D\)</span> – have the same module categories as the central simple algebras.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we care??</strong></p>
<p>Being a central division algebra is not compatible with base change (for example, <span class="math">\(\mathbf{H}\tensor\mathbf{C}\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math">\(M_2(\mathbf{C})\)</span>), but being a central simple algebra is.</p>
<div class="proposition">
If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> be a central simple algebra over <span class="math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is a field extension of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(A\tensor_k L\)</span> is a central simple algebra over <span class="math">\(L\)</span>.
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Centrality: the condition that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is central can be written like this. There is a natural map <span class="math">\(\alpha:A\to \Hom(A, A)\)</span> that sends <span class="math">\(a\)</span> to the map sending <span class="math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="math">\(ab-ba\)</span>. The center is precisely the kernel of this map. By flatness of everything over a field, if <span class="math">\(k\to A\)</span> identifies <span class="math">\(k\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\ker(\alpha)\)</span>, the same is true of <span class="math">\(L\to A\tensor_k L\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is central if and only if <span class="math">\(A \tensor_k L\)</span> is central.</p>
<p>Simplicity: the key here is the following amusing claim.</p>
<p><strong>Claim</strong>. If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a central simple algebra over <span class="math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math">\(L\)</span> a field extension of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, any non-zero two-sided ideal <span class="math">\(J\)</span> of <span class="math">\(A\tensor_k L\)</span> has non-zero intersection with <span class="math">\(L\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. (Farb and Dennis, Lemma 3.7) Choose <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="math">\(J\)</span> that has an expression <span class="math">\(x=\sum a_i\tensor\lambda_i\)</span> with minimal length. This implies that the <span class="math">\(\{a_i\}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\{\lambda_i\}\)</span> are linearly independent over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(a_1\neq 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is simple, we have that <span class="math">\(Aa_1A=A\)</span>, so there are <span class="math">\(x_j, y_j\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sum x_j a_1 y_j=1\)</span>. This means that <span class="math">\[x&#39;:=\sum_j x_j\tensor 1\left(\sum_i a_i\tensor\lambda_i\right)y_j\tensor 1=\sum_i a_i&#39;\tensor\lambda_i\]</span> is also in <span class="math">\(J\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(a_1&#39;=1\)</span> (so, in particular, <span class="math">\(x&#39;\neq 0\)</span>). For any <span class="math">\(a\in A\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\[(a\tensor 1)x&#39;-x&#39;(a\tensor 1)=\sum_{i\geq 2}(aa&#39;_i-a&#39;_ia)\tensor\lambda_i\]</span> (as <span class="math">\(a&#39;_1=1\)</span>, so it is central). But <span class="math">\(x\)</span> had minimal length, when we conclude that <span class="math">\(aa&#39;_i=a&#39;_ia\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is central, we have that each <span class="math">\(a_i&#39;\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, whence <span class="math">\[x&#39;=\sum 1\tensor a&#39;_i\lambda_i\in 1\tensor_k L,\]</span> as desired. QED the claim.</p>
<p>Conclusion: any non-zero two-sided ideal <span class="math">\(J\)</span> contains <span class="math">\((J\cap L)\cdot A\tensor L\)</span>, which is <span class="math">\(A\tensor_k L\)</span>. But then any non-zero two-sided ideal is the whole ring, as desired. QED</p>
<p>Note that in the claim above is not enough to assume that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is only a simple algebra over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>: if <span class="math">\(k = \mathbf{R}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A = L = \mathbf{C}\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(A\tensor_k L = \mathbf{C}\tensor_\mathbf{R} \mathbf{C}\)</span>, which is just <span class="math">\(\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}\)</span> which is not a simple <span class="math">\(\mathbf{C}\)</span> algebra.</p>
<div class="corollary">
If <span class="math">\(A_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A_2\)</span> are central simple algebras over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(A_1 \tensor_k A_2\)</span> is also a central simple algebra.
</div>
<div class="corollary">
If <span class="math">\(D_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(D_2\)</span> are central division algebras over <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(D_1\tensor_k D_2\)</span> is a central simple algebra, hence isomorphic to <span class="math">\(M_n(D_3)\)</span> for some central division algebra <span class="math">\(D_3\)</span>.
</div>
<div class="corollary">
Any central simple algebra <span class="math">\(A\)</span> over <span class="math">\(k\)</span> has the property that <span class="math">\(A\tensor\overline k\cong M_n(\overline k)\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. In fact, this is true over the <em>separable closure</em> of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> (see below).<br />

<div class="theorem">
(Tsen’s Theorem) A finite extension of <span class="math">\(\overline k (t)\)</span> is <span class="math">\(C_1\)</span>.
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Let p(x_1,…,x_n) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree <span class="math">\(d &lt; n\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\overline k (t)\)</span>. We want to find <span class="math">\(a_1(t),...,a_n(t)\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\overline k (t)\)</span>, not all 0, such that <span class="math">\(p(a_1(t),...,a_n(t)) = 0\)</span>.<br />Write <span class="math">\[a_i(t) = \sum_{j=0}^N b_{ij}t^j\]</span> and write <span class="math">\[p(t) = \sum_{l=0}^m f_l(t) q_l(x_1,...,x_n)\]</span> where <span class="math">\(f_l(t) \in \overline k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(q_l(x_1,...,x_n)\)</span> is a degree <span class="math">\(d\)</span> monomial, and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is the number of such monomials. Then, <span class="math">\[p(a_1(t),...,a_n(t) = \sum_{l=0}^m f_l(t) q_l(a_1(t),...,a_n(t)) = \sum_{r=0}^{Nd+M}g_r(\underline{b}_{ij})t^r\]</span> where M is the max degree of the <span class="math">\(f_l(t)\)</span>’s, for some polynomials <span class="math">\(g_r\)</span>.<br />But, thinking of the <span class="math">\(b_{ij}\)</span>’s as <span class="math">\((N+1)n\)</span> variables, <span class="math">\(Z(g_0(\underline{b}_{ij}),...,g_{Nd+M}(\underline{b}_{ij}))\)</span> is a nonempty affine variety over <span class="math">\(\overline k\)</span> defined by <span class="math">\(Nd+M+1\)</span> equations in <span class="math">\(\mathbf{A}^{(N+1)n}\)</span> (nonempty because <span class="math">\(b_{ij} = 0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(i,j\)</span> is a solution), hence must have dimension <span class="math">\(\ge (N+1)n-(Nd+M+1) = N(n-d)+n-M-1\)</span>. Because <span class="math">\(n-d &gt; 0\)</span>, choosing <span class="math">\(N\)</span> sufficiently large guarantees a nontrivial solution. Therefore <span class="math">\(p(x_1,...,x_n)\)</span> has a nontrivial root. QED.</p>
<h3 id="returning-to-central-simple-algebras">Returning to Central Simple Algebras</h3>
<div class="proposition">
Any central simple algebra <span class="math">\(A\)</span> over <span class="math">\(k\)</span> has the property that <span class="math">\(A\tensor k^s\cong M_n(k^s)\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\(A\)</span> splits over a separable closure of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.<br />
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Let $I = Isom(A,M_n): CAlg_k Set$ be the functor taking a commutative <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-algebra <span class="math">\(R\)</span> to the <span class="math">\(R\)</span>-algebra isomorphism $A_k R <span class="math">\(M_n(R)\)</span>. This is a scheme because we can define <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(M_n\)</span> via generators and relations and then parametrize isomorphisms between them (linear maps with polynomial conditions). This works in part because <span class="math">\(\phi: A\tensor R \to M_n(R)\)</span> is an isomorphism if and only if, for all <span class="math">\(\overline k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(R\to k\)</span>, the map <span class="math">\(\phi\tensor\overline k : A\tensor \overline k \to M_n(\overline k)\)</span> is an isomorphism. <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is nonempty because <span class="math">\(A\)</span> splits over <span class="math">\(\overline k\)</span> (<span class="math">\(A\tensor_k \overline k \cong M_n(\overline k)\)</span>). In fact, <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is a torsor under <span class="math">\(Isom(M_n, M_n)\)</span> in the fppf topology because it splits over <span class="math">\(\overline k\)</span> and any two elements of <span class="math">\(I\)</span> differ by an automorphism of <span class="math">\(M_n\)</span>. Using the Skolem-Noether Theorem (below) and descent in the fppf topology, we can then conclude <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is smooth, hence has a point over a separable extension. QED</p>
<div class="theorem">
(Skolem-Noether) The canonical sequence of Zariski sheaves <span class="math">\[ 1 \to \mathbf{G}_m \to GL_n \to Aut(M_n) \to 1 \]</span> is exact (with the last map conjugation by elements of <span class="math">\(GL_n\)</span>).<br />
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. First note that if <span class="math">\(\alpha \in GL_n\)</span> acts trivially, <span class="math">\(\alpha t = t \alpha\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, so $Z(M_n) M_n^x $, hence <span class="math">\(\alpha \in \mathbf{G}_m\)</span>.<br />To see exactness on the right, we use the following lemma. QED.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>. If <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is a local ring, then any automorphism <span class="math">\(M_n(R) \to M_n(R)\)</span> is conjugation by an invertible element <span class="math">\(\alpha \in GL_n(R)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. First, consider consider the classical case <span class="math">\(R = k\)</span>, a field. <span class="math">\(M_n(k)\)</span> has a unique simple module <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(\sigma \in Aut(M_n(k))\)</span>, consider the two actions of <span class="math">\(M_n(k)\)</span> on <span class="math">\(V\)</span> given by <span class="math">\((\alpha, v) \mapsto \alpha v\)</span> and <span class="math">\((\alpha, v) \mapsto \sigma(\alpha) v\)</span>.<br />Because <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is simple, there is an <span class="math">\(M_n(k)\)</span> isomorphism of these actions, i.e. <span class="math">\(\phi: V \to V\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\phi(\alpha v) = \sigma(\alpha)\phi(v)\)</span>, but <span class="math">\(\phi \in End(V) \cong M_n(k)\)</span>, hence <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is conjugation by <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>.<br />For the general case, let <span class="math">\(\sigma \in Aut(M_n(R))\)</span>. There exists a unique <span class="math">\(M_n(R)\)</span> module <span class="math">\(V\)</span> that is free over <span class="math">\(R\)</span> of rank <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Such a module exists (think columns) and is free because <span class="math">\(M_n(R) \cong V^n\)</span>. It is unique because if <span class="math">\(V&#39;\)</span> is another such module, by tensoring with the residue field <span class="math">\(k\)</span> of <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, we get an isomorphism <span class="math">\(V\tensor k \to \V&#39;\tensor k\)</span>. Because <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is projective, this lifts to a map <span class="math">\(V \to V&#39;\)</span>, which is surjective by Nakayama’s lemma. But, <span class="math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V&#39;\)</span> are free of the same rank, hence it must be an isomorphism.<br />Then, the argument above implies <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is conjugation.
